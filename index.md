# WODFlow Privacy Policy

WODFlow does not create accounts or collect personal contact information.
We do not store your workouts or any health data on our servers.

The app shows ads using Google AdMob and uses Google User Messaging Platform (UMP) to
request consent where required. These partners may receive device identifiers
(e.g., IDFA when you allow tracking), approximate location (via IP address),
advertising/usage data, and diagnostics to show, measure, and improve ads.
Apple may provide anonymized crash/performance reports in App Store Connect.

We do not sell your data.

**Managing consent & tracking**
- You can change tracking permission in iOS: Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking.
- For EEA/UK users, the consent prompt is managed by Google UMP; you can reopen it from
  the app’s consent prompt (when shown) or reset advertising settings in iOS.

**Ad/SDK providers**
- Google AdMob – https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads  
- Google UMP – https://developers.google.com/admob/ump/ios/overview

**Data retention**
WODFlow does not persist personal data. Ad/SDK partners retain data per their policies
(see links above).

**Children**
WODFlow is not directed to children under 13.
